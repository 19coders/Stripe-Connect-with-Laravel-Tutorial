## Stripe Connect - Build A Marketplace

This is no longer a 100% recommended implementation, as Laravel and the Stripe package have since exceeded the versions listed here.

### Stripe Connect Into Laravel

What this is, however, is a good example of how to integrate Stripe's Connect functionality, into Laravel.

The idea being, Laravel + Stripe = A website where you can sell things, which is cool, but none of the built in Billable classes work well with Stripe's Connect API.

### In the future...

I'll be moving this to a supported package for Laravel, or perhaps issue a pull request on the main Laravel/Stripe Cashier package, but for now, it remains just an example of how I configured the Laravel and normal Stripe APIs together to build a marketplace.
